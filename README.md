# Homer
A dead simple static **HOM**epage for your serv**ER** to keep your services on hand, from a simple `yaml` configuration file.

If you need authentication support, you're on your own (it can be secured using a web server auth module or exposing it only through a VPN network / SSH tunnel, ...)

**How to build / install it? Where is the webpack config?**
There is no build system (ðŸ˜±), use it like that! It's meant to be stupid simple & zero maintenance required. just copy the static files somewhere, and visit the `index.html`.


## configuration

Title, icons, links, colors, and services can be configured in the `config.yml` file, using [yaml](http://yaml.org/) format.


```yaml

# Services
# First level array represent a group.
# Leave only a "items" key if not using group (group name, icon & tagstyle are optional, section separation will not be displayed).
